          <div class="speech-bubble">
            <h4>The origins of today's Cooking.com originated in 2016 in San Bernadino, USA. Siblings Emma and Matthew Jones had an extreme interest in cooking since childhood and now wanted to open their own restaurant. But for this to be possible, the money was needed.</h4>
            <h4>So instead of opening a restaurant, the siblings decided to open an online recipe page where they could share their interest with others. Today, Cooking.com has grown a lot and within a year or two we will also open up our first restaurant.</h4>
