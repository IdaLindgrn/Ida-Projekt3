        <h1>Year 2016</h1>
        <p>The origins of today's Cooking.com originated in 2016 in San Bernadino, USA. Siblings Emma and Matthew Jones had an extreme interest in cooking since childhood and now wanted to open their own restaurant. But for this to be possible, the money was needed.</p>
        <p>So instead of opening a restaurant, the siblings decided to open an online recipe page where they could share their interest with others. Today, Cooking.com has grown a lot and within a year or two we will also open up our first restaurant.</p>

      <h1>Year 2018</h1>
        <p>Already after 2 years, Cooking.com had grown enormously. 3 new employees had joined the team and our customers were happy with the site, but we were not done there. We wanted to make the site grow even more with more well-developed recipes, a finer site and more satisfied customers.</p>
        <p>Our customers are the most important thing to us. We want you to get as much knowledge as you can from us and hopefully arouse your interest in cooking even more.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box9"> 
      <h1>Year 2023</h1>
        <p>By 2023, we hope that we have opened a restaurant. Being able to see our customers for real and treat people to recipes you spent months on would have been the dream. We are already setting up a place so hopefully, the restaurant open even earlier.</p>
        <p>The restaurant will be located in San Francisco, USA and has a very nice sea view. The food we will serve will be everything from previous recipes on our site to brand new dishes. It will be a great mix of everything!</p>
